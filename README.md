# CodeSamples

This repository contains code samples that are entirely my own
work. Some of the code was written as an independent project, while
other pieces are excerpts from collaborative projects. They are
intended to show a representation of my coding ability, interests, and
style.

I have also included a generic copy of my resume, a copy of my PhD
thesis, and a copy of a publication discussing some of my PhD
research.
