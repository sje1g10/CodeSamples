# Instructions

To run the Morse Code transmission:

```sh
python continuous_input.py
```

To write the Morse Code transmission to a .wav file:

```sh
python continuous_input.py -w 1
```

To learn about more options:

```sh
python continuous_input.py -h
```

It is also possible to run the morse.py script directly on a string
input. For example, the following will play a Morse Code transmission
of "Hello World":

```sh
python morse.py "Hello World"
```

To write this to a file, test.wav, instead, use the following command:

```sh
python morse.py "Hello World" -f test.wav -w 1
```

To find out about more options:

```sh
python morse.py -h
```
